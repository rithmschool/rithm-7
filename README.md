# README First!

Welcome Rithm 7! This is the master repository for your cohort with information about all of the topics we teach as well as links to assignment repositories for each of them.

### 1. You should bookmark this repo.

You do not need to clone or fork it as long as you have the link, because we may occasionally make updates to the content.

### 2. You are in charge of managing your own assignment code.

However, we recommend creating a separate repository on your own GitHub account for at least every **major project**.

### 3. Your weekly homework submission form is available here:

[https://goo.gl/forms/Kbe7Svl9IDvVLxKG3](https://goo.gl/forms/Kbe7Svl9IDvVLxKG3)

Fill this out at the beginning of every week, from week 2 until week 11.
